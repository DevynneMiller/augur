Project: Our project is updating the documentation, specifically making the Quickstart and Getting Started documentation more cohesive, revising outdated
or incorrect commands present in the install documentation, and reorganizing the table of contents for a better flow for the user.

In this Sprint we have updated the Requirements based on the notes left on our last Requirement Documentation and done out design documentation and Hello
World version of our project.
The use case and use case documentation are the same as before in Sprint 1. 

We have combined our design documentation and Hello World version of our project into one document that contains the adaptation of the table of contents 
and a detailed look at what we would like to fix, shift, and change in the installation sections that we think our most important to the goal of our
project. The combination of the design documentation and Hello World version was recommended by the professor since our project is updating the documentation.

During the Sprint we got a better idea of what truly needs changing within the installation documentation and have begun to setup a flow that should be easier
for users to follow for better understanding and less problems with installation.
