Project: Our project is updating the documentation, specifically making the Quickstart and Getting Started documentation more cohesive, revising outdated
or incorrect commands present in the install documentation, and reorganizing the table of contents for a better flow for the user.

In this Sprint we have began to update the .rst files in order to implement the flow outlined in our Design Documentation from Sprint 2. Specifically, we have updated the main toc tree so that the left hand side navigation table has the correct name changes and flow that we outlined in the Design Documentation. This is to help with understandability for the user and to create a better flow based on how a user would go through the installation process. We have also began to make changes inside the documents such as the index.rst which is the homepage of Augur. Here we have added the explanation of what Augur is to the top of the homepage as well as a Navigation portion which will help users understand whether they should go through the web server configuration and whether to choose Quickstart or the Detailed Installation for installing Augur based on their individual needs.
