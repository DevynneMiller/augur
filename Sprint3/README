Project: Our project is updating the documentation, specifically making the Quickstart and Getting Started documentation more cohesive, revising outdated
or incorrect commands present in the install documentation, and reorganizing the table of contents for a better flow for the user.

In this Sprint we have began to update the .rst files in order to implement the flow outlined in our Design Documentation from Sprint 2. Specifically, we have updated the main toc tree so that the left hand side navigation table has the correct name changes and flow that we outlined in the Design Documentation. This is to help with understandability for the user and to create a better flow based on how a user would go through the installation process. 

We have also began to make changes inside the documents such as the index.rst which is the homepage of Augur. Here we have added the explanation of what Augur is to the top of the homepage as well as a Navigation portion which will help users understand whether they should go through the web server configuration and whether to choose Quickstart or the Detailed Installation for installing Augur based on their individual needs. 

Within the Web Server Configuration, previously the Deployment section, we have completely taken out the 'Setting Up an Augur Server' section due to how redundant it is with the Quickstart and Detailed installation. Since the user will be forced to go through either the Quickstart or Detailed Installation we felt that this section could be lost all together within the Deployment section, hence the name change of the section as well. We are also planning to add an example of how to launch an EC2 instance to this section and the memory/space requirements that would be necessary in the fourth Sprint. 

The Quickstart will be largely left alone, except for troubleshooting that we plan to add in the fourth Sprint. This will add common problems that we ran into during installation testing in order to help the user if they run into the same common problems during their installation process.

During this Sprint we have updated installation.rst within the Detailed Installation section, previously Getting Started, in order to make it flow in parallel with the Quickstart. We have changed the name of the section to add clarity for users. In the fourth Sprint we plan to add troubleshooting for common problems we ran into while testing to this section as well. The Collecting data, Augur's Frontend, and Command Line interface will be left as they were before as we did not feel these were within the scope of our project.
