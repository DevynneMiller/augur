The directory augur/Sprint1/ contains the files for the use case documentation, the use case diagram, and the requirements documentation.

Our group will be updating the documentation for the installation of Augur.

Since we ran into quite a few problems installing Augur ourselves we wanted to update it to make it more usable for developers.
